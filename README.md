# brain-tumor-detect-and-segment
This project focuses on classification and segmentation of lower-grade gliomas (LGG) from MRI images using advanced deep learning techniques. By leveraging VGG-16 for classification and U-net for segmentation, this system can detect the presence of a tumor and identify its location with high accuracy.
